1.Define Encapsulation:

Encapsulation in Java is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods
into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data using access modifiers like private.

Simple Explanation (to say if asked further)

Data is hidden from outside classes

Access is given through methods

Improves security and data control

Real-Time Example

Like an ATM machine:
You cannot access cash directly; you must use allowed operations (withdraw, check balance).

Key Points (Interview Bullets)

Achieved using private variables

Accessed using public methods

Helps in data hiding

Increases maintainability

class Student {
    private int age;
    private String name;

    public void setData(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println(name);
        System.out.println(age);
    }
}

public class EncapsulationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setData("SAI", 21);
        s.display();
    }
}
What is Abstraction in Java?
Interview Definition

Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features to the user.

Simple Explanation (to say if asked further)

Focus on what the object does, not how it does

Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces

Real-Time Example

Like driving a car:
You use steering, brake, and accelerator without knowing engine internals.

Key Points (Interview Bullets)

Achieved using abstract class & interface

Abstract methods have no body

Improves security and flexibility

Supports loose coupling

🔁 One-Line Difference (Very Common Interview Question)

Encapsulation hides data, while Abstraction hides implementation.

abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();

    void fuel() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle needs fuel");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike starts with kick or self");
    }
}

public class AbstractionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Bike();
        v.start();
        v.fuel();
    }
}
